      <h3 class="person"> - Hedda Rogers</h3>      
       <p class="p-text">I recently sold a house with Dave and while this can be a very stressful process, 
         I felt 110% confident by partnering with Dave. He was candid, provided great feedback, 
         helped explain clearly all details and managed the actual sale negotiation brilliantly. 
         In addition, he was extremely responsive  to every one of my questions, no matter how small. 
         As I move forward to now BUY my next house, I am extremely certain Dave will be the right partner 
         to help me navigate this process. <strong>5/5 rating</strong></p>

       <p class="p-text">Robert has represented us on numerous real estate deals both buying and selling. 
         He has shown right from the start that he is extremely competent in real estate transactions. 
         We loved how he quickly responded to all of our questions as well as his knowledge of the whole process from start to finish. 
         Finally, Robert is very well respected in the real estate community and I think that goes a long way when it comes to negotiations.<strong> 5/5 rating</strong></p>

         <p class="p-text">We recently purchased a house in Marbella with Sara working as our buyer's agent. 
         This was complicated by the fact that we lived in St. Louis, MO at the time. From start to finish Sara ushered us through the process 
         in a very thorough and gracious manner. While we were on a brief first visit to Marbella, Sara gave us detailed and helpful information 
         about the condo market and neighborhoods in the city. After this we felt oriented and informed enough to make a purchase decision from out of state.
          After we decided on one building, Sara checked out four possibilities for us. Once we chose a unit, 
          she made a video tour for us so we could see what we would be getting. 
          Throughout the process we felt we could trust Sara to act in our best interests, 
          and our trust was entirely justified. We especially appreciated that she was successful in negotiating a later closing date, 
          which saved us from having to take out an expensive bridge loan! We wholeheartedly recommend Sara as a real estate agent! 
          We think anyone would find her engaging, understanding and very easy to work with.<strong> 5/5 rating</strong> </p></span>
